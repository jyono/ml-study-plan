Prompt to o1

I have an MS in computer science from Detroit Mercy. I am backend/distributed systems engineer with 7 YOE. I have strong CS fundamentals, but a shallow theoretically data science/ML background. I work at a company that builds end to end machine learning products. I have a decent sense of MLOps and infrastructure and tooling around it.

I want you to create me a systematic study plan to be on par with a PhD data scientist to round out my skill set. Make me a long term study plan in a 365 day by day format.

My calculus and stats are probably deficient.

+ some prodding to get it to markdown and actually do every day.



# 365-Day Data Science & ML Study Plan

At this stage, you’re transitioning from “learning widely” to “doing deeper research or advanced projects.” The daily structure might shift to longer project cycles with fewer distinct daily tasks. However, here’s a suggested outline:

### Days 241–270: Original Research or Comprehensive Project

**Day 241**  
- **Topic**: Identify Research Gap / Project Vision  
- **Tasks**: Reflect on your domain’s open problems. Draft a research question or novel approach you’d like to investigate.

**Day 242**  
- **Topic**: Literature Review  
- **Tasks**: Gather 5–10 relevant papers. Skim to see if your idea extends or addresses a known gap.

**Day 243**  
- **Topic**: Dataset Selection or Creation  
- **Tasks**: If existing data doesn’t suit your idea, consider combining or curating a new dataset.

**Day 244**  
- **Topic**: Experiment Design  
- **Tasks**: Outline how you’ll test your hypothesis. Plan baselines, metrics, how many experiments, etc.

**Day 245**  
- **Topic**: Early Implementation  
- **Tasks**: Start coding the baseline or core idea. Ensure you track hyperparameters and results methodically.

**Day 246–250**  
- **Topic**: Implementation & Iteration  
- **Tasks**: Each day, refine your approach, fix bugs, re-run experiments. Keep a lab notebook or marked commits.

**Day 251**  
- **Topic**: Intermediate Result Analysis  
- **Tasks**: Evaluate your results so far. Compare to baselines. Are you improving? Are you stuck?

**Day 252–255**  
- **Topic**: Rethink / Pivot if Needed  
- **Tasks**: If your approach isn’t working, revise your hypothesis or method. Possibly incorporate new ideas from recent papers.

**Day 256–260**  
- **Topic**: Expanded Experiments  
- **Tasks**: Try more hyperparameter sweeps. Collect logs. Evaluate final performance and compare to leading benchmarks (if any).

**Day 261**  
- **Topic**: Paper Draft (Optional)  
- **Tasks**: Start outlining a short paper or blog post describing your method, experiments, and results.

**Day 262–270**  
- **Topic**: Polishing & Verification  
- **Tasks**: Clean up code, replicate final results with a fresh environment or seeds. Make sure everything is fully documented.

### Days 271–300: Community, Collaboration, and Advanced Explorations

**Day 271**  
- **Topic**: Open-Source Collaboration  
- **Tasks**: Submit a pull request to an ML framework or a domain-specific project. Or share your research code publicly (if feasible).

**Day 272**  
- **Topic**: Peer Review & Feedback  
- **Tasks**: Ask a colleague/friend/online community to review your work. Incorporate constructive feedback.

**Day 273**  
- **Topic**: Advanced Hardware Acceleration (If relevant)  
- **Tasks**: Learn about GPU memory optimization, mixed precision training, or TPU usage.

**Day 274**  
- **Topic**: Paper Reading #9  
- **Tasks**: Select a cutting-edge paper from a recent conference. Summarize methods or try partial replication.

**Day 275**  
- **Topic**: Expand Project / Start New Sub-Project  
- **Tasks**: Possibly add a new dimension to your research. Or pivot to a new advanced sub-domain.

**Day 276–280**  
- **Topic**: Additional Implementation & Experiments  
- **Tasks**: Consistent daily progress. Each day, run relevant experiments. Evaluate changes in performance.

**Day 281**  
- **Topic**: Workshop or Conference Prep (if you wish to submit)  
- **Tasks**: Look up upcoming calls for papers. Polish your draft or design slides to share findings.

**Day 282–290**  
- **Topic**: Deep Dive Though Another Lens  
- **Tasks**: Possibly incorporate interpretability, fairness metrics, or domain adaptation methods. Evaluate them in your project.

### Days 291–330: Master’s-Level Depth & Teaching Others

**Day 291**  
- **Topic**: Teaching/Sharing ML Internally or Publicly  
- **Tasks**: Prepare a tutorial or internal workshop at your company. Summarize your best practices.

**Day 292**  
- **Topic**: Kaggle / Competition Attempt  
- **Tasks**: If you enjoy competitions, pick one. Apply your advanced knowledge to see how you rank.

**Day 293–300**  
- **Topic**: Reflection & Consolidation  
- **Tasks**: Each day pick 1–2 “lessons learned” from your major projects. Write them down in a personal reference doc.

**Day 301–320**  
- **Topic**: Additional Domain Mastery  
- **Tasks**: Use this 20-day block to broaden your domain knowledge further. Could be advanced NLP, CV, RL, or a new area (like Graph ML, GP models, quantum machine learning, etc.). Keep the daily structure: pick a sub-topic + tasks.

**Day 321–340**  
- **Topic**: Second Research Project or Collaboration  
- **Tasks**: Start a new collaborative project with peers or open-source contributors. Aim for better synergy, larger scale.

**Day 341–350**  
- **Topic**: Publish or Document Big Wins  
- **Tasks**: If feasible, finalize a paper, publish a significant blog post, or create a tutorial series summarizing your entire journey.

**Day 351–360**  
- **Topic**: Career/Skill Gap Analysis  
- **Tasks**: Identify if there are any major skills or math areas still lacking. Dedicate daily tasks to bridging those gaps (e.g., measure theory, advanced discrete math, specialized domain knowledge).

### Days 361–365: Final Wrap-Up & Vision Forward

**Day 361**  
- **Topic**: Full Portfolio Review  
- **Tasks**: Gather your projects, notebooks, major pieces of code. Order/present them nicely for a public portfolio or personal site.

**Day 362**  
- **Topic**: Community / Networking  
- **Tasks**: Reach out to ML communities, mentors, or potential collaborators. Share your year-long journey, gather feedback.

**Day 363**  
- **Topic**: Self-Assessment  
- **Tasks**: Revisit Day 1 goals. Write a thorough reflection on how far you’ve come, what you’ve mastered, and what’s next.

**Day 364**  
- **Topic**: Celebrating Milestones  
- **Tasks**: Reward yourself for a year of consistent effort! Possibly plan a short talk or workshop to celebrate your learning.

**Day 365**  
- **Topic**: Looking Ahead  
- **Tasks**: Define your 1–3 year plan. Will you pursue more research? A PhD? A specialized ML engineering role? Plan your next big step.
